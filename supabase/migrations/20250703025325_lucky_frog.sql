/*
  # Remove Admin Restrictions - Allow All Users Full Access

  1. Security Changes
    - Update all RLS policies to allow authenticated users full access
    - Remove admin-only restrictions
    - Maintain data security while allowing full functionality

  2. Policy Updates
    - Replace admin-only policies with authenticated user policies
    - Ensure all users can perform CRUD operations
    - Keep user isolation where appropriate (user-specific data)
